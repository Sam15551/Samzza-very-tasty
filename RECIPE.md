# Ingrediants for me pizza

### Step-1 : making the dough
> First, in a large bowl mix together 1.5 teaspoons instant yeast and ½ teaspoon of sugar.
> Add 1 cup of lukewarm water (44 degrees Celsius) and stir. Set aside and let the yeast activate.
> You should start to see the yeast mixture bubbling up and doubling in size after about 10 to 15 minutes.
> Combine 1 cup of unbleached all purpose flour (or bread flour) with 1 teaspoon of salt and 3 tablespoons of olive oil.
> Stir with a whisk or wooden spoon or steel spoon.
> Add one more cup of the flour.
> Keep on stirring. The mixture will be quite sticky. 
> Add the last cup of flour and continue to stir. The dough will start to form and leave the sides of the bowl, but will still be sticky.
> Now it’s time to knead the dough by hand until it forms a smooth dough. Dust with flour to prevent sticking as you work. The dough will be soft and elastic, and no longer sticky.
>  Keep your dough in the deep bowl, and lightly apply a bit of olive oil all around the outside of the dough. This will keep it from sticking to the sides of the bowl once the dough proves and grows.
> After exactly 1 hour my dough had risen and doubled up
> To make the pizza right away, portion and flatten the dough to a disk.

### Step-2 : Making Pizza Sauce from scratch
>You can choose to either chop the tomatoes (500 grams or 5 to 6 medium tomatoes) and use them fresh to make the sauce, or blanch them first and then add in a blender. Blanching will reduce the cooking time, but is not necessary for making a delicious sauce.
> Crush the raw or blanched tomatoes in the blender to make a puree that is as smooth or chunky as you like for this pizza recipe.
>  Next, in a large sauce pan heat ¼ cup olive oil, and add 2 teaspoons minced garlic. Sauté and stir for some seconds to soften the garlic.
> Now add the tomato puree, and mix well.
